        <h2>Mrs. Sunita Sharma</h2>
<p>(Managing Director)</p>

<p>"The Direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life " -Plato</p>

<p>We have stepped into a world where the horizons are unlimited. At one end of the spectrum is nano technology where the entire communication system proposes to be of the size of an air molecule; and at the other are the new frontiers vanquished in space travel.</p>

<p>The changing times have spelt corresponding changes in the upbringing and development of the child. Children have to be guided and encouraged to do their best by positive reinforcement.</p>

<p>We, at R. K. International School, believe that discipline is a must, but should be enforced by the hand in a velvet glove. Our students are motivated and encouraged to develop their overall personality but at the same time, they are taught to remain focused on their goals. They are made to set high goals and work towards achieving them. They are coached the 4 C’s of life i.e. Confidence, Control, Consistency and Candid behaviour.</p>

<p>Though we are confident that your ward is destined to become an upright, honest citizen, yet the necessity of continuous check on the child during formative years cannot be overlooked. Make it a part of your daily routine to check your child’s diary as through it you will come to know of the daily schedule of your ward, homework, assignments and any other important information. Parent teacher meetings are held on every fourth Saturday for establishing a link between the school and the teachers. In addition to it, the calendar in the school diary gives you an insight into the daily working, monthly plan and yearly schedule set for the child.</p>

"EDUCATION is the most powerful weapon Which you can use to change the world. "</p>

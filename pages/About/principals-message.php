<p><i>"By education, I mean an all-round drawing of the best in the child and man in body mind and spirit”.-Mahatma Gandhi<i></p><p> 
									</p><p>
We at R K International School firmly believe in the above saying by putting our efforts in the same direction. We provide an amicable, caring and safe environment where students can grow as confident and competent individuals. A true human being is one who is adorned with physical, mental, emotional and spiritual fitness that allows him/her to move forward. Our school focuses on the development of each child holistically. We seek to provide the students with a platform to perform and give them wings to fly under guided supervision, enabling and empowering them to realize their dreams. 
It is said ‘If you are planning for a year, sow rice; if you are planning for a decade, plant trees; if you are planning for a lifetime, educate people’. Indeed, one can even say that the quality of education will determine the destiny of the nation. Value in the positive psychological framework as a rubric is imperative for the success of our children in every sphere. We support and encourage our learners in their quest to develop a respectful and fulfilling relationship with their peers, staff and members of the community. Guidance in their search for meaning in the disciplines we introduce them to, prepares them for the world around them and in their interactions with others. Recognizing and rewarding accomplishment at all levels is our highest priority. We inspire learning for its own sake by sharing our joy, instilling a lifelong dedication to learning.</p>

<p>At R. K. International School, we aim to provide a happy, caring and stimulating environment and a better school, a better world fervently chiseling our pupils to equip them to understand everything, to have a holistic approach, a multi dimensional and multifaceted personality, strength of character, honesty and integrity and to be path setters of the future.</p>

<p>The vision of the school is to create a positive difference in the students that will inspire them to higher level of achievement and change. We aim to have a system that enables all students, including those with diverse needs, to meet or exceed rigorous standards for academic performance. All students are helped to develop attitudes, skills and habits of mind needed to succeed in and beyond the classroom. The members of the school community share a vision of educational excellence and work collaboratively to realize the vision.</p>

<p>Our value and vision is to transform the current demographic assets of our young students into a dynamic national force.</p>

International School is committed to create and maintain an orderly school where curricular and co-curricular activities are child centered and designed to accommodate individual learning styles so that all students may achieve the optimum. The school provides a challenging, enriching and purposeful learning environment on the belief that this engages students in maximum learning. Holistic, value based self-development through nurturing life skills forms the nucleus of this affirmative learning environment.</p>

<p>The school seeks to enrich knowledge related to lifespan learning, based on the most current and appropriate research and practice.</p>

<p>We are committed to an exceptional school which will make a difference. The alumni of our school will be cognizant, sensitive, reflective and participative individuals who take pride in themselves and the nation, impact and influence a changing society with confidence and creativity.</p>

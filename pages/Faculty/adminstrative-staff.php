Their role is critical co-ordinating the interaction of the school with the outside world and ensures that units and functions that are crucial to the working of any school – Infrastructure,  Medical Support, Security, Transport, Vendor Management etc. run smoothly. Along with the teaching staff, they also contribute to the upbringing of the students by ensuring that things are in place and working, so that the academic transactions and the mentoring of a child – which are the two core activities of any school – do go on without any interruptions. This team is the backbone of whole system.</p>

                    <p class="description"><i>Childhood is a state of mind which ends the moment a puddle is first
                            viewed as an obstacle instead of an opportunity. The most significant phase of human life,
                            childhood, is known for its naivety, innocence and simplicity. Neuroscience states that
                            neurons are highly active between 0 to 8 years of age, thus resulting in formation of
                            habits, acquiring moral values and etiquette and developing concepts for a lifetime.
                            Therefore real education needs to be imparted in these years so that the roots are strong
                            enough to bring up an intellectual youth having good habits, values and etiquette. Schooling
                            at this age needs to be very effective in instilling moral values of honesty, integrity and
                            truthfulness along with self confidence and self esteem. From kindergarten, we have been
                            laying the foundation and have seen our students passing out in XII as confident responsible
                            adults ready to face challenges in their lives. Holistic education is the need of the hour
                            to build a strong nation of youth equally strong in body mind and soul. We at Indus have
                            been pursuing our modest endeavors to contribute in producing a new generation of adults
                            physically strong, mentally balanced and emotionally stable. With the blessings of the
                            Almighty, and good wishes of our well wishers we hope to continue successfully treading the
                            path of Craftsmanship in generating noble citizens of the Nation.</i></p>

                            The focus of an activity based curriculum is teaching skills and knowledge to your students

                            them involved in the subject. We at R K International School organizes many class activities

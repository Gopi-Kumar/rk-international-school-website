                    "description": "Childhood is a state of mind which ends the moment a puddle is first viewed as an obstacle instead of an opportunity. The most significant phase of human life, childhood, is known for its naivety, innocence and simplicity. Neuroscience states that neurons are highly active between 0 to 8 years of age, thus resulting in formation of habits, acquiring moral values and etiquette and developing concepts for a lifetime. Therefore real education needs to be imparted in these years so that the roots are strong enough to bring up an intellectual youth having good habits, values and etiquette. Schooling at this age needs to be very effective in instilling moral values of honesty, integrity and truthfulness along with self confidence and self esteem. From kindergarten, we have been laying the foundation and have seen our students passing out in XII as confident responsible adults ready to face challenges in their lives. Holistic education is the need of the hour to build a strong nation of youth equally strong in body mind and soul. We at Indus have been pursuing our modest endeavors to contribute in producing a new generation of adults physically strong, mentally balanced and emotionally stable. With the blessings of the Almighty, and good wishes of our well wishers we hope to continue successfully treading the path of Craftsmanship in generating noble citizens of the Nation."

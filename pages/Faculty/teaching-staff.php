                    <p class="description"><i>Childhood is a state of mind which ends the moment a puddle is first
                            viewed as an obstacle instead of an opportunity. The most significant phase of human life,
                            childhood, is known for its naivety, innocence and simplicity. Neuroscience states that
                            neurons are highly active between 0 to 8 years of age, thus resulting in formation of
                            habits, acquiring moral values and etiquette and developing concepts for a lifetime.
                            Therefore real education needs to be imparted in these years so that the roots are strong
                            enough to bring up an intellectual youth having good habits, values and etiquette. Schooling
                            at this age needs to be very effective in instilling moral values of honesty, integrity and
                            truthfulness along with self confidence and self esteem. From kindergarten, we have been
                            laying the foundation and have seen our students passing out in XII as confident responsible
                            adults ready to face challenges in their lives. Holistic education is the need of the hour
                            to build a strong nation of youth equally strong in body mind and soul. We at Indus have
                            been pursuing our modest endeavors to contribute in producing a new generation of adults
                            physically strong, mentally balanced and emotionally stable. With the blessings of the
                            Almighty, and good wishes of our well wishers we hope to continue successfully treading the
                            path of Craftsmanship in generating noble citizens of the Nation.</i></p>

                            understand. I personally feel it is important for students. One has to develop the attitude
                            of developing questions like ‘Why’ and ‘How’ to encourage his own learning skills. If the
                            ‘Concepts’ are strong , your subject knowledge, critical, creative thinking is strong. Now
                            if you ask me what we have achieved from these exams? Exams develop them as an individual,
                            give values, extraordinary thinking, self assessment, overcome failures, filling them with
                            positivity to improve the quality of education. Examinations don’t mean creating a feeling
                            of depression among students. Exams are intended to develop a sense of responsibility among
                            those learners to remember the concepts and present them in the most valuable form. I
                            personally believe that if the process of examination is made effective tool of assessing
                            the real growth of the child then it can give us a more comprehensive report of the child
                            signifying his/her mental and cognitive development. If all the students consider exams as a
                            routine test with positive benefits, it will help them improve their self & increase their

                    The focus of an activity based curriculum is teaching skills and knowledge to your students through creative tasks and activities. Rather than students passively listening to a teacher, students will complete tasks that practice key skills and allow them to absorb information in an active way. At R K International School, education is not restricted to mere textbooks, but is a complete package aimed at holistic learning resulting in complete evolution of the body mind and soul. Real education provides the confidence and courage to face the challenges in life. It’s about teaching the child How to think rather than What to think. Equipping the child with adequate life skills, knowledge and wisdom to sustain himself or herself in the tough world. Activity-based learning is indulging students in activities by stimulating their senses, such as sight, smell, vision or feeling, and getting them involved in the subject. We at R K International School organizes many class activities and competitions time to time, to explore the hidden talent of the students. We provide every possibility to expose our students at different platforms in and out of the school so that our students get the every possible opportunity to develop their personality to enable them survive in this competitive world.
